## Executive Summary

**Key Insight:** Vertical SaaS (industry-specific) is hot. Construction SaaS raised $11.8B in 2025. APPIO's 8-position AI system is unique in the market.

**Recommended Model:** Tiered subscription + usage-based AI credits
- **Free Trial:** 14 days, full features, no credit card (18.2% conversion rate)
- **3 Tiers:** Starter ($199/mo), Professional ($499/mo), Enterprise (custom)
- **AI Credits:** Include monthly credits, charge for overages

**Why This Works:**
- 55% of SaaS companies use usage-based pricing (growing trend)
- Roofing contractors budget $175-350/user/month
- Free trial converts 3-4x better than freemium

---

## What Works in 2025

### 1. Subscription Models Still Win
- 61% of companies expect MORE SaaS adoption by 2026
- Predictable revenue = easier to grow
- Monthly/annual options (annual = 2 months free incentive)

### 2. Usage-Based Pricing (Growing Fast)
- 55% of SaaS companies now use some form of UBP
- Up from 35% in 2020
- Aligns price with value delivered

### 3. Free Trials Over Freemium
| Model | Conversion Rate |
|-------|-----------------|
| Freemium | 2.6% |
| Free Trial (opt-in) | 18.2% |
| Free Trial (credit card required) | 48.8% |

**Recommendation:** 14-day free trial, no credit card required

### 4. Tiered Pricing (Good-Better-Best)
- 3-4 tiers optimal
- 2-3x price jumps between tiers
- Highlight middle tier as "Most Popular"
- Middle tier highlight = +44% conversion to that tier

### 5. Annual Pricing Discount
- Offer 2 months free for annual payment
- Improves cash flow
- Reduces churn (locked in longer)

### 6. Transparent Pricing
- Show pricing if deals <$10K/year
- 76% of buyers want to solve problems themselves
- 68% don't want to talk to sales

---

## What Doesn't Work

### 1. Hidden Pricing
> "A VP at Userpilot expressed frustration at having to attend three separate sales meetings just to receive a pricing quote."

- Customers abandon if they can't find pricing
- "Contact us" = red flag for SMBs
- Only hide pricing for deals >$50K/year

### 2. Per-User Pricing (Often Wrong)
> "8 out of 10 companies using per user pricing should be using a different value metric."

- Creates barrier to adoption
- 100-person company won't pay enterprise price for basic features
- Consider per-project or per-seat instead

### 3. Too Many Options
- >4 tiers = decision paralysis
- Columbia research: too many choices = 40% less purchases
- Keep it simple: 3 tiers

### 4. Underpricing
- 43% of SaaS companies charge less than market would bear
- Low prices attract wrong customers
- Can't invest in product improvement

### 5. Set-and-Forget Pricing
- Companies testing pricing yearly grow 2-4x faster
- Review pricing every 6-12 months
- 94% of B2B SaaS update pricing annually

### 6. Aggressive Price Hikes
- 30-100% increases with 45 days notice = customer rage
- Budgets grow only 2.8%/year
- AI bundling to hide price increases = trust killer

### What Customers HATE (Direct Quotes)
- "Hidden fees"
- "Forced AI features I don't need"
- "Too many add-on charges"
- "Per-user pricing when I just need basic features"
- "Can't cancel easily"
- "Price increased 50% with no notice"

## Pricing Psychology

### Tactics That Convert

| Tactic | Impact | How to Apply |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Charm Pricing** | +24% sales | Use $199, $499, $999 not $200, $500, $1000 |
| **Anchoring** | Shapes perception | Show highest tier first |
| **Recommended Badge** | +44% middle tier | "Most Popular" on Professional |
| **Urgency** | +31% signups | "Founding member pricing ends [date]" |
| **Scarcity** | +26% value perception | "Limited to 100 beta users" |
| **Transparency** | +15-25% conversion | Show all fees, easy cancellation |

### The Harvard Rule
> "1% improvement in pricing = 11% increase in operating profit"

Pricing is the most under-optimized part of most businesses.

### Conversion Benchmarks

| Metric | Average | Good | Great |
|--------|---------|------|-------|
| Website to Trial | 2-5% | 5-10% | 10%+ |
| Trial to Paid | 10-15% | 15-20% | 25%+ |
| Freemium to Paid | 2-3% | 3-5% | 6-8% |

- AccuLynx charges extra for "standard" features = customer frustration

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Beta Launch (Month 1-2)

**Goal:** Get 50-100 beta users, validate pricing

```
Founding Member Pricing: 50% off for life
- Starter: $99/mo (normally $199)
- Professional: $249/mo (normally $499)
- Limited to first 100 users
- Countdown timer on pricing page
```

**Why This Works:**
- Urgency drives action (+31% signups)

- Early adopters become evangelists
- Locked-in revenue from loyal customers

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Month 3-4)

**Goal:** 500 users, $50K MRR

1. **Free Trial:** 14 days, full Professional features
2. **No Credit Card Required:** Lower friction (18% vs 49% conversion trade-off worth it for trust)
3. **Onboarding:** Automated email sequence
4. **Support:** Chat + email

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 5-12)

**Goal:** 2,000 users, $250K MRR

1. **Referral Program:** Give $50, get $50 credit
2. **Annual Push:** Extra month free for annual
3. **Case Studies:** Success stories from beta users
4. **Integrations:** QuickBooks, EagleView, Procore

### Phase 4: Scale (Year 2+)

**Goal:** Enterprise sales, $1M+ ARR

1. **Enterprise Tier:** Custom pricing, dedicated support
2. **Agency Program:** Multi-company management
3. **API Partnerships:** Become platform others build on
4. **Vertical Expansion:** Beyond roofing to all Division 07

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario

| Month | Users | MRR | ARR |
|-------|-------|-----|-----|
| 3 | 100 | $25,000 | $300,000 |
| 6 | 300 | $75,000 | $900,000 |
| 12 | 750 | $187,500 | $2,250,000 |
| 24 | 2,000 | $500,000 | $6,000,000 |

**Assumptions:**
- 50% Starter ($199), 40% Professional ($499), 10% Enterprise ($999 avg)
- Average revenue per user: $250/mo
- 5% monthly churn

### Optimistic Scenario (AI Differentiation)

| Month | Users | MRR | ARR |
|-------|-------|-----|-----|
| 3 | 200 | $60,000 | $720,000 |
| 6 | 600 | $180,000 | $2,160,000 |
| 12 | 1,500 | $450,000 | $5,400,000 |
| 24 | 5,000 | $1,500,000 | $18,000,000 |

**Key Drivers:**
- 8 AI positions = no one else has this
