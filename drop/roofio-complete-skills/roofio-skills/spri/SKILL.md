## SPRI Standards

### ANSI/SPRI Wind Standards

#### ANSI/SPRI ES-1: Edge Metal Systems

**Purpose:** Test and classify edge metal for wind resistance

**Test Method:**
1. Mount edge assembly on test apparatus
2. Apply positive and negative pressure cycles
3. Measure deflection and failure point
4. Classify per rating

**Classifications:**
| RE Rating | Test Pressure | Application |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| RE-1 | 30 psf | Light wind areas |
| RE-2 | 45 psf | Moderate wind |
| RE-3 | 60 psf | Standard commercial |
| RE-4 | 75 psf | Higher wind areas |
| RE-5 | 90 psf | High wind coastal |

**Required by IBC:** Section 1504.5

**Edge Types Tested:**
- Gravel stop (fascia)
- Drip edge
- Coping
- Copings with counterflashing

#### ANSI/SPRI GT-1: Gutter Systems

**Test Criteria:**
- Wind uplift resistance
- Structural adequacy
- Water drainage capacity
- Attachment method

**Classifications:**
- GT-1 through GT-5 (similar to ES-1)

#### ANSI/SPRI IA-1: Insulation Attachment

**Scope:** Adhesive and mechanical attachment of insulation

**Adhesive Requirements:**
- Coverage patterns defined
- Temperature limits
- Application rates

**Mechanical Requirements:**
- Fastener patterns
- Pullout values
- Spacing tables

## SPRI Technical Documents

### Wind Design

**SPRI Wind Design Guide:**
1. Determine basic wind speed
2. Calculate design pressures (ASCE 7)
3. Identify roof zones
4. Select appropriate assembly
5. Specify attachment schedule

**Perimeter and Corner Enhancements:**
```
Zone 2 (Perimeter):
- Typically 1.5× field attachment
- Width = 10% of least dimension (max 40')

Zone 3 (Corner):
- Typically 2.0× field attachment  
- Extends from corner per calculation
```

### SPRI Technical Guidelines

#### SPRI VR-1: Vapor Retarders

**When Required:**
- High interior humidity
- Cold climates (Zones 5-8)
- Cooling-dominated buildings (some)

**Types:**
| Class | Permeance | Material Examples |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| I | ≤0.1 perm | Polyethylene, aluminum |
| II | 0.1-1.0 perm | Kraft-faced insulation |
| III | 1.0-10 perm | Latex paint |

**Installation:**
- Continuous (seal all joints)
- Turn up at walls
- Seal at penetrations
- Under insulation

#### SPRI FB-1: Fastener Corrosion

**Fastener Selection:**
| Environment | Fastener Type |
|-------------|---------------|
| Standard | Carbon steel, galvanized |
| Coastal (<1 mile) | Stainless steel |
| Industrial/chemical | Stainless steel |
| High humidity interior | Stainless steel |

**FM Approved Fasteners:**
- Must be listed for specific assembly
- Verify compatibility with deck

#### SPRI RP-4: Maintenance Guidelines

**Recommended Inspections:**
- Semi-annual (spring and fall)
- After severe weather
- Before warranty expiration

**Maintenance Tasks:**
```
Routine:
□ Clear debris from drains
□ Remove vegetation
□ Trim overhanging trees
□ Check flashing sealants
□ Inspect penetration seals

As Needed:
□ Repair membrane damage
□ Replace deteriorated sealants
□ Re-secure loose flashings
□ Clean ponding areas
```
