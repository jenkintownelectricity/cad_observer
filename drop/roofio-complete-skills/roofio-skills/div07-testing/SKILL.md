## Field Testing Methods

### Seam Testing

#### Probe Test
**Purpose:** Verify seam bond continuity

**Procedure:**
1. Allow seam to cool (minimum 5 minutes)
2. Use blunt-tipped probe
3. Apply firm, consistent pressure
4. Move along entire seam length
5. Mark any separations
6. Repair and re-test defects

**Frequency:** 100% of all seams

**Acceptance:** No separation under firm pressure

#### Cut Test (Destructive)
**Purpose:** Verify weld quality and width

**Procedure:**
1. Cut 1" wide sample across seam
2. Attempt to peel apart
3. Measure bonded width
4. Evaluate failure mode

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Minimum 1.5" bonded width
- Film-tearing bond (not adhesive failure)
- Repair test location

#### Peel Test
**Purpose:** Quantify seam strength

**Procedure:**
1. Cut test sample from seam
2. Clamp in tensile tester
3. Pull at constant rate
4. Record peak force

**Requirements (typical):**
- TPO: 8 lbf/in minimum
- PVC: 8 lbf/in minimum
- EPDM tape: 3 lbf/in minimum

### Adhesion Testing

#### Field Pull Test
**Purpose:** Verify membrane-to-substrate bond

**Procedure:**
1. Cut 2" × 2" square through membrane
2. Attach pull fixture
3. Apply perpendicular force
4. Record force at failure
5. Note failure mode

**Typical Requirements:**
- Adhered membrane: 5-10 lbf minimum
- Flashing: Higher requirements

#### Torque Test (Fasteners)
**Purpose:** Verify fastener engagement

**Procedure:**
1. Apply torque wrench to fastener
2. Record breakaway torque
3. Compare to requirements

**Typical Values:**
- Steel deck: 50+ in-lbf
- Wood deck: 40+ in-lbf
- Concrete: Per anchor specifications

## Moisture Detection

### Infrared Thermography

**Principle:** Wet insulation retains heat differently than dry

**Best Conditions:**
- Clear sky night
- After sunny day
- Minimum ΔT: 15°F (day-night)
- Dry roof surface

**Equipment:**
- Infrared camera
- Thermal sensitivity: <0.1°C

**Interpretation:**
| Pattern | Indication |
|---------|------------|
| Warm areas (night) | Potential moisture |
| Cool areas (day) | Potential moisture |
| Uniform temperature | Likely dry |

**Limitations:**
- Surface moisture affects readings
- Ballasted roofs difficult
- Requires verification (cores)

### Nuclear Moisture Meter

**Principle:** Hydrogen atom detection (water contains hydrogen)

**Procedure:**
1. Establish dry baseline reading
2. Create grid pattern (10' × 10' typical)
3. Take reading at each point
4. Record and map results
5. Verify anomalies with cores

**Interpretation:**
| Reading | Indication |
|---------|------------|
| 0-4% | Dry |
| 4-10% | Marginal |
| >10% | Wet |

### Electrical Capacitance

**Principle:** Water changes capacitance

**Applications:**
- Under membrane detection
- Quick scanning
- Non-destructive

**Equipment Types:**
- Surface contact meters
- Non-contact scanners

### Electrical Impedance (ELD/EFVM)

**Principle:** Water conducts electricity

**Low Voltage (EFVM):**
- Used on dry membrane
- Finds breaches
- Non-destructive to membrane

**High Voltage (Holiday Testing):**
- Used on fluid-applied systems
- Finds pinholes
- Requires conductive surface

**Procedure (EFVM):**
1. Wet roof surface
2. Apply low voltage (40-60V)
3. Connect ground
4. Scan with detector
5. Mark breach locations

## Flood Testing

### Standard Flood Test

**Purpose:** Verify waterproof integrity

**Procedure:**

4. Maintain for 24-48 hours
5. Inspect interior for leaks
6. Document results

**Requirements:**
- Structural engineer approval
- Maximum depth per structure
- Weather conditions considered
- Continuous monitoring

**Applications:**
- New construction acceptance
- Plaza decks
- Below-grade waterproofing
- Warranty verification

### Spray Testing

**Per ASTM E1105:**
- Calibrated spray rack
- Specified pressure and flow
- Timed duration
- Interior observation

2. Install in pressure chamber
3. Apply pressure from below
4. Increment: 15 psf steps
5. Hold each level 1 minute
6. Continue to failure

**Rating = Pass pressure × Safety factor (1.5)**

### UL 580

**Similar to FM 4470:**
- Air pressure cycling
- Uplift resistance classification
- UL 30, 60, 90 ratings

### Dynamic Wind Testing
