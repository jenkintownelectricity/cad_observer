## Leak Investigation Process

### Step 1: Gather Information

**Questions to Ask:**
```
□ When did leak first appear?
□ Does it leak every rain or only heavy rain?
□ Does it leak during wind-driven rain?
□ Does it leak with snow/ice melt?
□ Any recent roof work or damage?
□ HVAC condensation possible?
□ Plumbing above leak location?
□ History of previous leaks/repairs?
```

**Information to Collect:**
- Building drawings (roof plan)
- Previous leak reports
- Repair history
- Maintenance records
- Warranty status
- Roof age and system type

### Step 2: Interior Investigation

**Map the Leak:**
```
1. Locate water entry point (stain, drip)
2. Measure from fixed points (walls, columns)
3. Transfer to roof plan
4. Note: Water travels - entry may not be above stain

Water Travel Patterns:
- Runs along deck flutes (steel)
- Follows insulation joints
- Pools at obstructions
- Can travel 50+ feet before appearing
```

**Interior Inspection:**
- Ceiling stains (fresh vs. old)
- Wet insulation in ceiling cavity
- Rusted deck
- Mold/mildew presence
- Multiple stain locations

### Step 3: Exterior Investigation

**Roof Inspection Zones:**
```
Priority 1 (Check first):
□ Directly above leak (transfer point)
□ Penetrations in area
□ Flashings upslope
□ Drains/scuppers

Priority 2:
□ Seams in general area
□ Field membrane
□ Adjacent flashings

Priority 3:
□ Perimeter edge
□ Expansion joints
□ Wall cladding interface
```

**Visual Inspection Checklist:**
```
MEMBRANE:
□ Punctures, cuts, tears
□ Open seams
□ Blisters (check if wet)
□ Wrinkles/bridging
□ Ponding areas
□ Surface deterioration

FLASHINGS:
□ Open terminations
□ Failed sealant
□ Loose/lifted flashings
□ Corroded metal
□ Missing counter flashing

PENETRATIONS:
□ Cracked pipe boots
□ Open joints
□ Failed sealant
□ Missing covers

DRAINAGE:
□ Blocked drains
□ Ponding water
□ Scupper condition
□ Gutter/downspout issues
```

## Detection Methods

### Visual Inspection

**Tools Needed:**
- Flashlight
- Binoculars (for height)
- Probe/pick
- Chalk/marker
- Camera
- Measuring tape

**Best Practices:**
- Systematic pattern (perimeter in, grid)
- Morning dew reveals low spots
- After rain shows drainage issues
- Look for discoloration, debris patterns

### Water Testing

#### Controlled Flood Test
**Procedure:**
1. Identify suspect area
2. Create dam around area
3. Add water to 2-4" depth
4. Mark water level
5. Wait 24-48 hours
6. Monitor interior for leaks
7. Document results

**Limitations:**
- Structural load concerns
- Large areas impractical
- Temperature limitations
- Time consuming

#### Spray Testing
**ASTM E1105 Standard:**
```
Equipment:
- Spray rack/nozzle
- Pressure gauge
- Flow meter
- Timer

Parameters:
- Pressure: 5 psi at nozzle
- Flow rate: 5 gal/hr/SF
- Duration: 15 min minimum
- Interior observation required
```

**Progressive Spray Test:**
1. Start at lowest point
2. Spray small area
3. Monitor interior
4. Move up/outward if no leak
5. Isolate leak source

### Electronic Leak Detection

#### EFVM (Electric Field Vector Mapping)
**Principle:** Water conducts electricity; breaches allow current flow

**Procedure:**
1. Wet entire roof surface
2. Create electrical circuit
3. Place perimeter wire
4. Energize system (40-60V DC)
5. Scan with detection wand
6. Mark signal locations
7. Verify with probe/cut test

**Best Applications:**
- Single-ply membranes
- Fluid-applied membranes
- New construction QC
- Warranty leak calls

**Limitations:**
- Conductive membranes not testable
- Requires wet surface
- Metal in contact disrupts readings

#### Low Voltage (Wet Method)
- 40-60 volts
- Larger area scanning
- Standard for most membranes

#### High Voltage (Dry Method)
- 15,000-35,000 volts
- For fluid-applied systems
- Finds pinholes
- Dry surface required

### Infrared Thermography

**Principle:** Wet insulation holds heat differently

**Best Conditions:**
```
Timing: 2-4 hours after sunset
Requirements:
- Clear sky
- Sunny day prior
- ΔT >15°F (day/night)
- Dry roof surface
- No wind

Temperature differential causes:
- Wet areas appear warmer at night
- Wet areas appear cooler during day
```

**Equipment:**
- Thermal camera (≥320×240)
- Sensitivity: <0.1°C
- Digital camera for reference

**Interpretation:**
| Pattern | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Linear warm area | Wet insulation at seam |
| Circular warm area | Wet insulation at penetration |
| Large irregular area | Extensive moisture |
| Uniform temperature | Likely dry |

**Verification:**
- Core sample at anomaly
- Compare to control core
- Document findings

### Nuclear Moisture Testing

**Principle:** Detects hydrogen atoms (water contains hydrogen)

**Procedure:**
1. Establish dry baseline
2. Grid pattern (5-10' spacing)
3. Take reading at each point
4. Record values
5. Map results
6. Core sample high readings

**Interpretation:**
| Reading (%) | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| 0-4 | Dry |
| 4-8 | Marginal |
| 8-15 | Wet |
| >15 | Very wet |

**Advantages:**
- Non-destructive
- Quantitative data
- Portable
- Works through most membranes

**Limitations:**
- Not precise location
- Affected by deck type
- Radiation source (licensed)

### Capacitance Meters

**Principle:** Water changes electrical capacitance

**Applications:**
- Quick scanning
- Identify suspect areas
- Non-destructive
- No special licensing

**Limitations:**
- Relative readings
- Affected by membrane type
- Surface moisture interference
