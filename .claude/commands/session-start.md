# Session Start Protocol

Starting a new Claude Code session. Execute the following initialization:

## Step 1: Read Context Files
Read these files to understand current state:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - AI agent instructions and constraints
2. `SESSION-LOG.md` - Recent session history, problems, solutions
3. `CLAUDE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Current priorities

## Step 2: Check Project Status
Run these commands to understand current state:
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## Step 3: Enable Best Practice Mode
Activate these permanent skills:
- **Commit Curator**: Conventional Commits standard
- **Context Enforcer**: Follow architectural constraints
- **Mandatory Validation**: Test before code changes
- **Documentation Guardian**: Keep docs updated

## Step 4: Confirm Understanding
Summarize:
- What was done last session
- What are the current priorities
- Any blockers or issues to address

## Step 5: Ask Clarifying Questions
Before starting work, ask:
- What specific task should we focus on?
- Any new constraints or preferences?
- Expected outcome?

**Session initialized.** Ready to proceed with Best Practice Mode active.
