## Research Framework: The 5 Lenses

When researching ANY topic, Claude MUST examine it through these 5 lenses:

### 1. Customer Voice (Love/Hate Analysis)

**Always search for:**
- "software name reviews"
- "software name complaints"
- "software name problems"
- "what users hate about [topic]"
- "why users love [software]"

**Extract:**
- Direct user quotes (negative AND positive)
- Common pain points
- Delightful surprises
- Feature requests
- G2, Capterra, Reddit, forum complaints

**Questions to answer:**
- What makes users rage-quit?
- What makes them evangelists?
- What's the #1 requested feature?
- What's "surprisingly good" that people didn't expect?

---

### 2. Innovation Radar

**Search for:**
- "[topic] AI 2025"
- "[topic] startup funding"
- "[topic] new technology"
- "revolutionary [topic]"
- "disruptive [topic] startup"

**Look for:**
- Y Combinator companies in the space
- Recent funding announcements
- Patents filed
- Academic papers being commercialized
- Features no one else has yet

**Questions to answer:**
- Who's the scrappy underdog disrupting giants?
- What technology exists but isn't mainstream yet?
- What are the "3 years from now" predictions?

---

### 3. Old Tool + AI Alchemy

**The key question:** What legacy tools are "good enough" but could be REVOLUTIONARY with AI?

**Examples to inspire:**
- Excel spreadsheets → AI estimating (Beam AI)
- Paper forms → AI document extraction
- Manual scheduling → Predictive AI scheduling
- Phone calls → AI voice assistants
- Walkthrough inspections → 360 camera + AI mapping

**Search patterns:**
- "manual [task] alternative"
- "[old tool] but with AI"
- "automate [task]"
- "AI replaces [job function]"

**Questions to answer:**
- What are people still doing manually that's insane in 2025?
- What Excel spreadsheet is crying out to be an app?
- What repetitive task could AI handle 90% of?

---

### 4. Integration Goldmine

**Search for:**
- "[software] integrations"
- "[software] API"
- "[software] + [other software]"
- "connect [software] to [software]"

**Look for:**
- What tools does EVERYONE integrate with? (QuickBooks, Procore, etc.)
- What integrations are missing that users beg for?
- What data flows between systems?
- Where are the manual copy-paste workflows?

**Questions to answer:**
- What's the "must have" integration in this industry?
- What two tools should talk to each other but don't?
- Where does data get stuck in silos?

---

### 5. UI/UX Benchmark

**Search for:**
- "best [industry] app design"
- "[software] UI"
- "[software] user experience"
- "modern [industry] software interface"
- "construction app design"

**Evaluate:**
- Mobile experience (field workers need mobile-first)
- Load time and performance
- Learning curve complaints
- Color schemes and typography used
- Information density vs. simplicity

**Questions to answer:**
- Who has the best-looking app in this space?
- What's the standard users expect now?
- What UI patterns work for field workers?

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this research methodology when:
- User asks to "research" anything
- User wants to "look into" a topic
- User asks "what's the best" in a category
- User wants to understand a market/industry
- Building a new feature and need context
- Evaluating competitors

[topic] AI
```

### Customer Sentiment
```
"[software] is terrible"
"[software] saved my"
"switched from [software] to"
reddit [software] complaints
```

### Innovation

## Remember

1. **Users over features** - What do PEOPLE say, not marketing copy
2. **Problems = opportunities** - Every complaint is a feature idea
3. **AI everything** - If it's manual and repetitive, AI can help
4. **Simple wins** - Best software does one thing excellently
5. **Mobile first** - If it doesn't work on a phone, it doesn't work
