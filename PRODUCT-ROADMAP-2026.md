## CROSS-MODULE INTELLIGENCE

The magic happens when modules talk to each other:

```
TRIGGER                          → AUTO-ACTIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Weather delay logged             → Update schedule → Adjust cash flow → Notify stakeholders → Log for claim
Material price spike             → Flag open bids → Suggest rebid → Update projections → Alert operations
Crew finishes early              → Dispatcher reallocates → Update schedules → Notify PMs
QC finds defect                  → Create punch list → Alert foreman → Log crew score → Update %
Invoice overdue                  → Escalate collections → Pause scheduling → Notify owner
Safety incident                  → Investigation workflow → Update EMR → Assign training
Submittal approved               → Release material order → Update drawings → Schedule delivery
```
