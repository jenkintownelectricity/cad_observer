# Roofing Standards Hierarchy

## The Layered System

Roofing standards are **not** a single rulebook. They are a layered system that starts with model building codes (the law), relies on scientific testing (the performance), and is refined by local climate conditions (the reality).

---

## Layer 1: THE LAW (Model Codes)

### International Code Council (ICC)

**International Building Code (IBC)**
- Scope: Commercial and multi-family buildings
- Chapter 15: Roof Assemblies and Rooftop Structures
- Chapter 16: Structural Design (loads)
- Updated: Every 3 years (2021, 2024, 2027...)

**International Residential Code (IRC)**
- Scope: One- and two-family dwellings
- Chapter 9: Roof Assemblies
- Simpler requirements than IBC

**The AHJ Factor**
- AHJ = Authority Having Jurisdiction
- Your local building department has final say
- Can accept IBC/IRC as-written OR enforce stricter amendments
- Examples: Florida Building Code, California Title 24, NYC Building Code

### Key IBC Chapter 15 Sections

| Section | Title | Requirement |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1501 | General | Scope and applicability |
| 1502 | Definitions | Terms used in chapter |
| 1503 | Weather Protection | Roof coverings shall protect building |
| 1504 | Performance Requirements | Wind, uplift, impact |
| 1505 | Fire Classification | Class A, B, or C required |
| 1507 | Roof Covering Materials | Specific material requirements |
| 1510 | Reroofing | Re-cover vs. replacement rules |

---

## Layer 2: THE TEST (Performance Standards)

### ASTM International

**Fire Resistance Testing**
- **ASTM E108 / UL 790**: Fire classification for roof coverings
  - Class A: Severe fire exposure (required in WUI zones)
  - Class B: Moderate fire exposure
  - Class C: Light fire exposure

**Wind Resistance Testing**
- **ASTM D3161**: Wind resistance of steep slope roofing
- **ASTM D7158**: Wind resistance of sealed asphalt shingles
- **ASTM E1592**: Structural performance of sheet metal roof panels

**Membrane Testing**
- **ASTM D6878**: TPO sheet roofing
- **ASTM D4434**: PVC sheet roofing
- **ASTM D4637**: EPDM sheet vulcanized rubber

**Impact Testing**
- **UL 2218**: Impact resistance (hail simulation)
  - Class 1: 1.25" steel ball, lowest resistance
  - Class 2: 1.5" steel ball
  - Class 3: 1.75" steel ball
  - Class 4: 2" steel ball, highest resistance

### UL (Underwriters Laboratories)

**Wind Uplift**
- **UL 580**: Uplift resistance of roof assemblies
- **UL 1897**: Uplift tests for roof covering systems

**Fire**
- **UL 790**: Standard test methods for fire tests of roof coverings
- **UL 723** (ASTM E84): Surface burning characteristics

### FM Global

**FM Approval Testing**
- **FM 4450**: Class 1 insulated steel roof decks
- **FM 4470**: Single-ply roof assemblies (dynamic wind)
- **FM 4474**: Evaluating adhesives/fastening systems

**FM Ratings**
- Format: 1-XX (e.g., 1-60, 1-90, 1-120)
- Number = design pressure resistance in psf x 1.5 safety factor
- FM 1-90 = can resist 90 psf = designed for 60 psf

---

## Layer 3: THE ENFORCER (Local Requirements)

### Regional Code Amendments

**Florida Building Code**
- High Velocity Hurricane Zone (HVHZ): Miami-Dade, Broward
- Product approvals required (FL numbers)
- Miami-Dade NOA (Notice of Acceptance)
- Wind speeds: 150-180+ mph in coastal zones

**Texas (Coastal)**
- Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) approvals
- Windstorm certification required
- WPI-8 form for compliance

**California**
- Title 24: Energy efficiency requirements
- Cool roof requirements (SRI values)
- WUI (Wildland-Urban Interface) fire ratings

**New York City**
- NYC Building Code amendments
- Additional requirements beyond IBC
- Special inspections required

### Climate Zone Requirements

| Climate Zone | Primary Concerns | Typical Requirements |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1-2 (Hot) | Heat, hurricanes | Cool roofs, high wind ratings |
| 3-4 (Mixed) | Variable | Moderate insulation, wind |
| 5-6 (Cold) | Snow, ice | High R-value, ice/water shield |
| 7-8 (Very Cold) | Heavy snow | Enhanced structural, thermal |

---

## Layer 4: THE METHOD (Best Practices)

### NRCA (National Roofing Contractors Association)

**The NRCA Roofing Manual**
- 4-volume set, updated annually
- Volume 1: Membrane Roofing
- Volume 2: Metal Panel Roofing
- Volume 3: Steep-Slope Roofing
- Volume 4: Architectural Metal Flashing

**Key NRCA Standards**
- Minimum 8" base flashing height
- Proper drainage (1/4" per foot minimum slope)
- Flashing details for every condition
- Workmanship standards

### Manufacturer Installation Standards

Installation standards from manufacturers often **exceed** code minimums:

| Requirement | Code Minimum | Manufacturer (Typical) |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Fastener pattern | Varies by zone | Specific per product |
| Seam width | Not specified | 2.5" min (TPO) |
| Adhesive coverage | Not specified | Full coverage for warranty |
| Flashing height | 4" (some codes) | 8" (NRCA/mfr standard) |

### IIBEC Standards

**Assessment Levels**
- Level 1: Walk-through survey
- Level 2: Comprehensive with testing
- Level 3: Forensic investigation

**Documentation Standards**
- Moisture survey protocols
- Core sample procedures
- Report formats

---

## Layer 5: THE MONEY (Insurance & Warranty)

### Insurance Requirements

**FM Global**
- FM-approved assemblies for commercial insurance
- RoofNav database for assembly selection
- Annual inspections may be required

**Standard Insurance**
- Class 4 impact = premium discounts (hail regions)
- Cool roofs = energy credits
- Proper documentation = claim support

### Manufacturer Warranties

**Warranty Voidance Triggers**
- Non-approved substrate
- Incorrect fastener pattern
- Unauthorized repairs
- Missing inspections
- Environmental damage exclusions

**Warranty Hierarchy**
| Type | Coverage | Typical Term |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Material Only | Manufacturing defects | 10-20 years |
| System | Material + labor | 15-25 years |
| NDL (No Dollar Limit) | Full replacement | 20-30 years |

## Decision Flow: Which Standard Applies?

```
START: What type of building?
|
+-> Commercial/Multi-family
|   +-> IBC Chapter 15 + Chapter 16
|       +-> Check AHJ amendments
|           +-> FM required? -> RoofNav
|           +-> No FM -> NRCA + Manufacturer
|
+-> Residential (1-2 family)
|   +-> IRC Chapter 9
|       +-> Check local amendments
|           +-> Manufacturer installation guide
|
+-> Special Location?
    +-> Florida -> Florida Building Code + NOA
    +-> California -> Title 24 + WUI if applicable
    +-> Texas Coast -> TDI + WPI-8
    +-> NYC -> NYC Building Code amendments
```

## Quick Reference: Who Decides What?

| Question | Primary Authority | Secondary |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| "Is this legal?" | IBC/IRC + AHJ | State amendments |
| "Does it perform?" | ASTM/UL test | FM/UL listing |
| "Is it installed right?" | NRCA Manual | Manufacturer guide |
| "Is it insurable?" | FM Global | Insurance underwriter |
| "Is it under warranty?" | Manufacturer | Installation records |

## Roofio Integration

When you ask Roofio a compliance question, it checks:

1. **Code Layer**: IBC/IRC requirements for building type
2. **Test Layer**: Required ASTM/UL/FM ratings
3. **Local Layer**: AHJ amendments for project location
4. **Method Layer**: NRCA + manufacturer standards
5. **Money Layer**: Warranty requirements

Every answer cites the authoritative source.
