## IIBEC Guidelines

### Roof Condition Assessment

**Assessment Levels:**

**Level 1 - Walk-Through Survey:**
- Visual observation only
- Document general conditions
- Identify obvious defects
- Recommend further investigation

**Level 2 - Comprehensive Survey:**
- Detailed visual inspection
- Core samples (destructive)
- Moisture detection
- Photo documentation
- Written report

**Level 3 - Forensic Investigation:**
- Complete system evaluation
- Multiple test methods
- Failure analysis
- Expert opinion
- Litigation support

### Assessment Methodology

**Visual Inspection Checklist:**
```
Membrane:
□ Blisters (location, size, quantity)
□ Ridges/wrinkles
□ Splits/tears
□ Punctures
□ Surface deterioration
□ Seam condition
□ UV degradation

Flashings:
□ Base flashing height
□ Counter flashing condition
□ Sealant condition
□ Mechanical attachment
□ Edge metal condition
□ Expansion joint condition

Drainage:
□ Ponding water
□ Drain condition
□ Scupper condition
□ Gutter/downspout condition
□ Debris accumulation

Penetrations:
□ Pipe boots condition
□ Equipment curbs
□ HVAC penetrations
□ Electrical conduits
□ Vent stacks
```

### Core Sample Protocol

**Purpose:**
- Verify system composition
- Check for moisture
- Measure insulation thickness
- Evaluate adhesion

**Procedure:**
1. Select representative locations
2. Cut 2" × 2" minimum sample
3. Document each layer
4. Test for moisture
5. Repair immediately
6. Label and photograph

**Minimum Samples:**
- Small roofs (<10,000 SF): 4-6 cores
- Medium (10,000-50,000 SF): 8-12 cores
- Large (>50,000 SF): 1 per 5,000 SF

### Moisture Survey Methods

**Infrared Thermography:**
- Non-destructive
- Surveys large areas quickly
- Best at night after sunny day
- Identifies thermal anomalies

**Nuclear Moisture Meter:**
- Quantifies moisture content
- Grid pattern readings
- Compare to dry baseline
- Non-destructive

**Electrical Capacitance:**
- Detects moisture in assembly
- Good for membrane surveys
- Non-destructive
- Portable units available

**Core Verification:**
- Confirms other methods
- Provides actual moisture content
- Identifies wet layers
- Required for certainty
