## FM Approval System

### What FM Approval Means

```
FM APPROVED = Tested + Listed + Quality Controlled

Components:
1. Product tested to FM standards
2. Assembly listed in RoofNav
3. Manufacturing quality monitored
4. Follow-up inspections conducted
```

### FM Approval Marks

## FM Data Sheets (Loss Prevention)

### Key Roofing Data Sheets

| DS Number | Title | Topic |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1-28 | Wind Design | Design pressures, ratings |
| 1-29 | Roof Deck Securement | Deck attachment |
| 1-31 | Metal Roof Systems | Standing seam, metal panels |
| 1-32 | Vegetated Roof Systems | Green roofs |
| 1-34 | Hail Damage | Hail resistance |
| 1-35 | Green Roof Systems | Additional guidance |
| 1-49 | Perimeter Flashing | Edge metal requirements |
| 1-52 | Field Verification | Inspection procedures |
| 1-54 | Roof Loads | Snow, rain, equipment |

### DS 1-28: Wind Design

**Basic Wind Speed Determination:**
1. Use FM Global wind map (or ASCE 7)
2. Determine exposure category
3. Calculate design pressure
4. Select FM rating

**FM Wind Ratings:**
```
Rating = Required Uplift × 1.5 Safety Factor

FM 1-60:  40 psf design (60 psf test)
FM 1-90:  60 psf design (90 psf test)
FM 1-120: 80 psf design (120 psf test)
FM 1-150: 100 psf design (150 psf test)
FM 1-180: 120 psf design (180 psf test)
FM 1-240: 160 psf design (240 psf test)
FM 1-300: 200 psf design (300 psf test)
FM 1-435: 290 psf design (435 psf test)
```

**Roof Zone Definitions (FM):**
| Zone | Location | Typical Pressure Factor |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| 1 | Field | 1.0 |
| 2 | Perimeter | 1.5-1.75 |
| 3 | Corner | 2.0-2.5 |

### DS 1-29: Roof Deck Securement

**Steel Deck Fastening:**
```
Minimum Weld Requirements:
- 36/4 pattern: 36" deck, 4 welds/sheet
- 36/5 pattern: 36" deck, 5 welds/sheet (enhanced)
- Weld spacing: Maximum 12" OC

Mechanical Fasteners:
- #12 minimum
- 12" OC maximum at supports
- All four corners of each sheet
```

**Re-Cover Deck Considerations:**
- Existing attachment evaluation required
- May require supplemental fastening
- Maximum one re-cover in FM assembly

### DS 1-49: Perimeter Flashing

**FM ES-1 Compliance:**
- All edge metal must meet ANSI/SPRI ES-1
- Test pressures match roof zone
- Continuous attachment required

**Edge Detail Requirements:**
| Detail | FM Requirement |
|--------|----------------|
| Gravel stop | Tested per ES-1, rated |
| Fascia | Continuous cleat |
| Coping | Splice plates, rated |
| Gutter | Match Zone 2 rating |

## FM RoofNav

### What is RoofNav?
Online database of all FM Approved roof assemblies. Required for specifying FM-compliant systems.

**Access:** roofnav.com (subscription required for full access)

### Using RoofNav

**Step 1: Enter Project Information**
```
- Building location (address)
- Building height
- Building dimensions
- Exposure category
- Roof slope
```

**Step 2: Get Wind Requirements**
```
RoofNav calculates:
- Required FM rating (Zone 1, 2, 3)
- Design wind pressures
- Edge securement requirements
```

**Step 3: Search Assemblies**
```
Filter by:
- Membrane type
- Attachment method
- Insulation type
- Deck type
- Fire classification
```

**Step 4: Generate Specification**
```
Output includes:
- Assembly number
- Component layers
- Fastener schedule
- Maximum spacing
- Installation requirements
```

### RoofNav Assembly Example

```
Assembly: TPO-4567
Rating: FM 1-120 (Field), 1-180 (Perimeter), 1-240 (Corner)
Fire: Class 1

Deck: 22 ga steel, 36/4 weld pattern
Barrier: FM Approved vapor retarder
Insulation Layer 1: 2.5" polyiso, adhered
Insulation Layer 2: 2" polyiso, adhered
Cover Board: 1/2" high-density polyiso
Membrane: 60 mil TPO, fully adhered

Perimeter Enhancement: 6" OC fasteners, 12" from edge
Corner Enhancement: 6" × 6" pattern, 24" from corner
```

## FM Testing Standards

### FM 4450: Class 1 Insulated Roof Decks

**Fire Test Requirements:**
- Calorimeter test (heat release)
- Spread of flame test
- Burning brand test
- Intermittent flame test

**Classifications:**
- Class 1: Passes all tests (FM Approved)
- Non-classified: Fails one or more

### FM 4470: Single-Ply Roofing

**Wind Uplift Test:**
1. Assembly built to spec
2. Air pressure applied from below
3. Pressure increased incrementally
4. Failure = air reaches surface or components separate

**Test Pressures:**
| Duration | Pressure Level |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 minute | 50% of rating |
| 1 minute | 75% of rating |
| 1 minute | 100% of rating |
| Pass | No failure at 100% |

### FM 4473: Steep Slope Test

**For slopes >2:12:**
- Modified test procedure
- Accounts for gravity effects
- Separate ratings from low-slope

### FM 4474: Adhesive Tests

**Evaluates:**
- Bond strength (peel test)
- Wind uplift contribution
- Temperature performance
- Aging characteristics
