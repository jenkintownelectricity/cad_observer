# ROOFIO Partnership & Integration Package
## Master Launch Document v2.0

---

## Executive Summary

**Roofio** is a Division 07-specific AI assistant designed to act as a "Digital Journeyman" for roofing professionals. Built by Lefebvre Design Solutions, it combines 20+ years of shop drawing expertise with Union Instructor pedagogy to create the industry's first compliant, verified AI system.

**The Problem:** Apprentices and PMs are using generic AI (ChatGPT) for technical roofing questions. The results are dangerous hallucinations that violate code and void warranties.

**The Solution:** A closed-loop system that rejects "internet data" in favor of verified industry standards from NRCA, IIBEC, FM Global, and manufacturer technical libraries.

---

## THE LAYERED STANDARDS SYSTEM

Roofio understands that roofing standards are not a single rulebook but a layered system:

| Layer | Organization | Function | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|---------|
| **The Law** | ICC (IBC/IRC) | Sets baseline legal requirements | "You must have a fire-resistant roof" |
| **The Test** | ASTM / UL | Creates pass/fail experiments | "This shingle survives 2-hour burn test" |
| **The Enforcer** | Local Building Dept (AHJ) | Inspects and approves | "We require Class A in this county" |
| **The Method** | NRCA / Manufacturers | Defines installation techniques | "Use 6 nails per shingle for warranty" |
| **The Money** | Insurance / Warranties | Drives compliance through risk | "Class 4 impact for coverage discount" |

### Performance Testing Standards Roofio Knows:

**Fire Resistance (ASTM E108 / UL 790):**
- Class A: Highest protection (wildfire zones)
- Class B: Moderate protection
- Class C: Light protection

**Wind Uplift (ASTM D3161 / UL 580):**
- Hurricane zones: 130-150+ mph ratings required
- FM 4470 dynamic wind testing

**Impact Resistance (UL 2218):**
- Class 1 (weakest) to Class 4 (strongest)
- Steel ball hail simulation

### Regional Load Calculations:
- **Dead Load:** Weight of roof structure/materials
- **Live Load:** Temporary weight (workers, equipment)
- **Snow Load:** Northern states reinforcement requirements
- **Wind Load:** Coastal fastening patterns (6 nails vs 4)

## OUTREACH DOCUMENTS

### Document 1: NRCA Partnership Email

**To:** Mark S. Graham, VP Technical Services (NRCA)
**Subject:** Proposal: AI Integration for NRCA Manual (From Union Instructor & Business Owner)

---

Dear Mr. Graham,

My name is Armand Lefebvre, President of Lefebvre Design Solutions and a current Union Apprentice Instructor. I am writing to you because the roofing industry is about to be flooded with "AI experts" that have never set foot on a roof, and I want to ensure the NRCA remains the single source of truth in that new landscape.

I am currently developing "Roofio," a Division 07-specific AI designed to assist shop drawing detailers and field superintendents. Unlike generic models that "guess" based on internet scrapings, my system is being built on strict engineering verification.

**The Problem:**

Apprentice roofers and junior detailers are already using tools like ChatGPT to answer technical questions. Currently, those tools often hallucinate or provide non-compliant advice because they do not have access to the NRCA Roofing Manual. This creates a liability for contractors and dilutes the NRCA's authority.

**The Proposal:**

I am requesting a commercial data licensing discussion to integrate the NRCA Roofing Manual directly into my system's retrieval database.

- **Control:** The AI will be constrained to cite only NRCA-verified details for installation queries.
- **Training:** As a Union Instructor, I intend to use this as a "Digital Journeyman" tool to help apprentices navigate the manual, not replace it.
- **Revenue:** I am prepared to discuss a per-seat licensing fee or royalty structure that opens a new digital revenue stream for the NRCA.

I have the shop drawing database and the field experience to build this correctly. I would prefer to build it **with** you than **around** you.

Are you available next Tuesday or Thursday afternoon to discuss what a data partnership would look like?

Best regards,

**Armand Lefebvre**
President, Lefebvre Design Solutions
Union Apprentice Instructor, Local 30

### Document 2: IIBEC Technical Advisory Committee Abstract

**To:** Emily Lorenz, Sr. Director of Technical Services (IIBEC)
**Subject:** TAC Presentation Proposal: AI-Assisted Forensics in Division 07

---

**Title:** Beyond the Photograph: AI-Assisted Forensics & Pattern Recognition in Division 07 Failures

**Abstract:**

Current roof inspections rely entirely on the subjective memory and experience of the individual observer. This session explores the application of Computer Vision (CV) trained specifically on IIBEC failure modes.

Presented by a dual-degree holder in Construction & Facilities Management and Union Instructor, this presentation demonstrates "Roofio": a system capable of identifying blistering, ridging, and seam failure from site photos and instantly correlating them with historic failure data.

The presentation will focus on the "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow—how consultants can use this tool to validate their findings rather than replace their expertise.

**Presenter Credentials:**
- 20+ years journeyman roofer/waterproofer experience
- President, Lefebvre Design Solutions (shop drawings for JHU, Saint-Gobain)
- Degrees in Construction Management and Facilities Management
- Union Apprentice Instructor, Local 30

**Proposed Duration:** 45 minutes + 15 minutes Q&A

### Document 3: Manufacturer Partnership Request

**To:** Strategic Accounts / Technical Services
**Subject:** Strategic Partnership: Integrating [MANUFACTURER] Data into Division 07 AI

---

To the Strategic Accounts Team,

I am the President of Lefebvre Design Solutions. We produce shop drawings for major commercial projects (clients include Saint-Gobain, Triangle General Contractors, Johns Hopkins University).

We are currently digitizing our workflow into **Roofio**, an AI-driven specification and detailing assistant.

**The Opportunity:**

When a user asks Roofio, "Show me a detail for a TPO curb," the system retrieves a verified detail. Currently, the system defaults to generic industry standards. **I want to prioritize [MANUFACTURER] details.**

To do this efficiently, I need access to your technical library (Details, Data Sheets, Guide Specs) in a structured format (API, JSON, or direct bulk download).

**Why Partner?**

1. **Specification Control:** Ensure your latest 2025/2026 specs are the ones being used, not outdated PDFs found on Google.

2. **Liability Reduction:** My system is built on my 20+ years of experience in shop drawings and code compliance. It filters out non-compliant applications before they reach the drawing board.

3. **Direct Traffic:** Every detail served includes a direct link to your product page for submittals.

I have already successfully integrated data from other partners. I would like to add [MANUFACTURER] to the verified library this week.

Who is the best technical contact to discuss data integration?

Best regards,

**Armand Lefebvre**
President, Lefebvre Design Solutions

### Document 4: Barrett Roofing "Trojan Horse" Pitch

**To:** [Your Barrett Contact]
**Format:** Email or In-Person

---

Hey [Name],

I'm building something that solves the bottleneck we always hit with shop drawings: the back-and-forth on code compliance.

It's a specialized AI called **Roofio**. I've fed it the IBC, ASCE 7 wind codes, and (with your permission) I want to feed it the full Barrett technical library.

**The Goal:** I want to run a pilot where my shop drawing team uses it on our next Barrett project. It will automatically flag if a detail matches your specific warranty requirements before we even send it to you for review.

It saves me time, but it saves your technical rep from having to redline the same basic mistakes ten times.

**I don't need money.** I just need:
1. Access to your technical data in a clean format
2. If it works, a letter saying Barrett endorses the tool for checking warranty compliance

You game to be the first manufacturer on this?

---

### Document 5: ICC Code Connect Application

**Portal:** ICC Code Connect / API Portal
**Use Case Description:**

---

"We are a specialized Roofing Shop Drawing and Consulting firm (Lefebvre Design Solutions) developing an internal compliance tool for Division 07.

The application ('Roofio') acts as a real-time code-checker for commercial roofing assemblies. It utilizes user-supplied project addresses to query ASCE 7 hazard data and cross-references it against ICC building code requirements for wind uplift and fire ratings.

**Commercial Intent:** We intend to bundle this 'Code Check' feature into our shop drawing services for clients like Saint-Gobain and Johns Hopkins University. We require an API key that supports high-frequency queries for specific code sections (IBC Chapter 15 & 16)."

---

## TECHNICAL DATA SPECIFICATION

**Title:** Project Roofio - Technical Data Requirements
**To:** Technical Services / IT Division
**From:** Lefebvre Design Solutions

---

**Objective:** To ingest Manufacturer Technical Libraries (Details, Product Data Sheets, Guide Specs) into the Roofio Vector Database for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

### Preferred Data Formats (In order of preference):

1. **JSON / XML Feed:** Structured data linking Product IDs to their specific PDF URLs and metadata (ASTM standards, mil thickness, warranty duration).

2. **Sitemap / Directory Access:** A complete index of the Technical Library URLs.

3. **Bulk PDF Export:** A zipped archive of current 2025/2026 details and specs.

### Metadata Requirements:

To ensure the AI recommends the correct detail for the correct condition, we request data tags for:

| Field | Example Values |
|-------|----------------|
| System Type | TPO, PVC, EPDM, Mod Bit, BUR |
| Attachment Method | Mechanically Fastened, Fully Adhered, Ballasted |
| Deck Type | Steel, Concrete, Wood, Gypsum |
| Warranty Level | 20-Year NDL, 30-Year Platinum |
| Spec Section | 07 54 00, 07 55 00, 07 52 00 |
| FM Rating | 1-60, 1-90, 1-120, etc. |
| Detail Type | Base Flash, Curb, Drain, Edge, Penetration |

### Integration Protocol:

Roofio utilizes a **vector embedding pipeline**. We do not train the model on your data (which risks leakage). We **index** your data. When a user queries a detail, the system retrieves the specific PDF from your library and cites it as the source.

### Security:

- All data stored in encrypted vector database
- No redistribution of source PDFs
- User access controlled by license tier
- Audit logging of all queries
